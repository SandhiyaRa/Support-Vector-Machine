Support Vector Machine
Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classification algorithm. This Notebook  covers  python coding to solve iris flower classification problem using svm and sklearn library. We also describe different parameters such as gamma, regularization and how to fine tune svm classifier using these parameters. Basically the way support vector machine works is it draws a hyper plane in n dimension space such that it maximizes  the margin between classification groups.
